I have decided to change the theme to star wars and incorperated ajax and api from giffy. I currently have an issue trying with the win condition, but can't seem to resolve it. Will work on the css some more.

## 8/26 - 
I will be making the trivia theme a space theme that asks questions pertaining to the universe. I have an interest in space and the mystery it holds and putting questions into the game that revolves around this field will be fun and challenging at the same time.
